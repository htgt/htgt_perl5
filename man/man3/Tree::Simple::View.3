.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This serves as an abstract base class to the Tree::Simple::View::* classes. There are 
two implementing classes included here; Tree::Simple::View::HTML and Tree::Simple::View::DHTML. 
Other Tree::Simple::View::* classes are also being planned, see the \*(L"\s-1TO DO\*(R"\s0 section 
for more information.
.PP
These modules should be considered stable and ready for production use. We have been using 
this module in production on a number of sites for several years now without issue.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.ie n .IP "\fBnew ($tree, \fB%configuration\fB)\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBnew ($tree, \f(CB%configuration\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "new ($tree, %configuration)"
Accepts a \f(CW$tree\fR argument of a Tree::Simple object (or one derived from Tree::Simple), 
if \f(CW$tree\fR is not a Tree::Simple object, and exception is thrown. This \f(CW$tree\fR object 
does not need to be a \s-1ROOT,\s0 you can start at any level of the tree you desire. The options 
in the \f(CW%config\fR argument are determined by the implementing subclass, and you should 
refer to that documentation for details.
.IP "\fBgetTree\fR" 4
.IX Item "getTree"
A basic accessor to reach the underlying tree object.
.IP "\fBgetConfig\fR" 4
.IX Item "getConfig"
A basic accessor to reach the underlying configuration hash.
.IP "\fBincludeTrunk ($boolean)\fR" 4
.IX Item "includeTrunk ($boolean)"
This controls the getting and setting (through the optional \f(CW$boolean\fR argument) of the 
option to include the tree's trunk in the output. Many times, the trunk is not actually 
part of the tree, but simply a root from which all the branches spring. However, on 
occasion, it might be nessecary to view a sub-tree, in which case, the trunk is likely 
intended to be part of the output. This option defaults to off.
.IP "\fBsetPathComparisonFunction ($CODE)\fR" 4
.IX Item "setPathComparisonFunction ($CODE)"
This takes a \f(CW$CODE\fR reference, which can be used to add custom path comparison features 
to Tree::Simple::View. The function will get two arguments, the first is the \f(CW$current_path\fR, 
the second is the \f(CW$current_tree\fR. When using \f(CW\*(C`expandPath\*(C'\fR, it may sometimes be 
nessecary to be able to control the comparison of the path values. For instance, your 
node may be an object and need a specific method called to match the path against.
.IP "\fBexpandPath (@path)\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandPath (@path)"
This method will return a string which will represent your tree expanded along the 
given \f(CW@path\fR. This is best shown visually. Given this tree:

As you can see, the given path has been expanded, but no other sub-trees are shown. The 
details of this are subject to the implementating subclass, and their documentation should 
be consulted.
.Sp
It should be noted that this method actually calls either the \f(CW\*(C`expandPathSimple\*(C'\fR or 
\&\f(CW\*(C`expandPathComplex\*(C'\fR method depending upon the \f(CW%config\fR argument in the constructor.
.ie n .IP "\fBexpandPathSimple ($tree, \fB@path\fB)\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBexpandPathSimple ($tree, \f(CB@path\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandPathSimple ($tree, @path)"
Within this base package, this is an abstract method, it will throw an exception if 
called.
.Sp
If no \f(CW%config\fR argument is given in the constructor, then this method is called by 
\&\f(CW\*(C`expandPath\*(C'\fR. This method is optimized since it does not need to process any configuration, 
but just as the name implies, it's output is simple.
.Sp
This method can also be used for another purpose, which is to bypass a previously 
specified configuration and use the base \*(L"simple\*(R" configuration instead.
.ie n .IP "\fBexpandPathComplex ($tree, \fB$config\fB, \f(BI@path\fB)\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBexpandPathComplex ($tree, \f(CB$config\fB, \f(CB@path\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandPathComplex ($tree, $config, @path)"
Within this base package, this is an abstract method, it will throw an exception 
if called.
.Sp
If a \f(CW%config\fR argument is given in the constructor, then this method is called 
by \f(CW\*(C`expandPath\*(C'\fR. This method has been optimized to be used with configurations, and 
will actually custom compile code (using \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR) to speed up the generation of the 
output.
.Sp
This method can also be used for another purpose, which is to bypass a previously 
specified configuration and use the configuration specified (as a \s-1HASH\s0 reference) 
in the \f(CW$config\fR parameter.
.IP "\fBexpandAll\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandAll"
This method will return a string of \s-1HTML\s0 which will represent your tree completely 
expanded. The details of this are subject to the implementating subclass, and their 
documentation should be consulted.
.Sp
It should be noted that this method actually calls either the \f(CW\*(C`expandAllSimple\*(C'\fR or 
\&\f(CW\*(C`expandAllComplex\*(C'\fR method depending upon the \f(CW%config\fR argument in the constructor.
.IP "\fBexpandAllSimple\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandAllSimple"
Within this base package, this is an abstract method, it will throw an exception 
if called.
.Sp
If no \f(CW%config\fR argument is given in the constructor, then this method is called 
by \f(CW\*(C`expandAll\*(C'\fR. This method too is optimized since it does not need to process any 
configuration.
.Sp
This method as well can also be used to bypass a previously specified configuration 
and use the base \*(L"simple\*(R" configuration instead.
.IP "\fBexpandAllComplex ($config)\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandAllComplex ($config)"
Within this base package, this is an abstract method, it will throw an exception 
if called.
.Sp
If a \f(CW%config\fR argument is given in the constructor, then this method is called by 
\&\f(CW\*(C`expandAll\*(C'\fR. This method too has been optimized to be used with configurations, and 
will also custom compile code (using \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR) to speed up the generation of the output.
.Sp
Just as with \f(CW\*(C`expandPathComplex\*(C'\fR, this method can be to bypass a previously specified 
configuration and use the configuration specified (as a \s-1HASH\s0 reference) in the 
\&\f(CW$config\fR parameter.

.IP "\fBTree::Simple::View::HTML\fR" 4
.IX Item "Tree::Simple::View::HTML"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBTree::Simple::View::DHTML\fR" 4
.IX Item "Tree::Simple::View::DHTML"
.PD
.PP
There are a few modules out there that I have seen which do similar things to these modules. 
I have attempted to describe them here, but not being a user of these modules myself, 
I can not do them justice. If you think I have mis-represented or just under-represented 
these modules, please let me know. Also, if I have not included a module which should be here, 
let me know and I will add it.
.IP "\fBData::TreeDumper\fR" 4
.IX Item "Data::TreeDumper"
This module is an alternative to Data::Dumper for dumping out any type of data structures. 
As the author points out, the output of Data::Dumper when dealing with tree structures can 
be difficult to read at best. This module solves that problem by dumping a much more readable 
and understandable output specially for tree structures. Data::TreeDumper has many options 
for output, including custom filtersand coloring. I have been working with this modules author  
and we have been sharing code. Data::TreeDumper can output Tree::Simple objects 
(<http://search.cpan.org/~nkh/Data\-TreeDumper\-0.15/TreeDumper.pm#Structure_replacement>). 
This givesTree::Simple the ability to utilize the \s-1ASCII/ANSI\s0 output  styles of Data::TreeDumper. 
Nadim has used some of the code from  Tree::Simple::View to add \s-1DHTML\s0 output to Data::TreeDumper. 
The \s-1DHTML\s0 output can be without tree-lines as for Tree::Simple:View or with tree-lines as with 
Data::TreeDumper.
.IP "\fBHTML::PopupTreeSelect\fR" 4
.IX Item "HTML::PopupTreeSelect"
This module implements a \s-1DHTML \s0\*(L"pop-up\*(R" dialog which contains an expand-collapse tree, which 
can be used for selecting an item from a hierarchy. It looks to me to be very configurable 
and have all its bases covered, right down to handling some of the uglies of 
cross\-browser/cross\-platform \s-1DHTML.\s0 However it is really for a very specific purpose, and 
not for general tree display like this module.
.IP "\fBHTML::TreeStructured\fR" 4
.IX Item "HTML::TreeStructured"
This module actually seems to do something very similar to these modules, but to be honest, 
the documentation is very, very sparse, and so I am not really sure how to go about using it. 
From a quick read of the code it seems to use HTML::Template as its base, but after that I 
am not sure.
.IP "\fBCGI::Explorer\fR" 4
.IX Item "CGI::Explorer"
This module is similar to the HTML::PopupTreeSelect, in that it is intended for a more 
singular purpose. This module implements a Windows-style explorer tree.

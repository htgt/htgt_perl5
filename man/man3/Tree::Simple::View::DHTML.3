.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a class for use with Tree::Simple object hierarchies to serve as a means of 
displaying them in \s-1DHTML.\s0 It is the \*(L"View\*(R", while the Tree::Simple object hierarchy 
would be the \*(L"Model\*(R" in your standard Model-View-Controller paradigm.
.PP
This class outputs fairly vanilla \s-1HTML,\s0 which is augmented with \s-1CSS\s0 and javascript 
to produce an expanding and collapsing tree widget. The javascript code used is 
intentionally very simple, and makes no attempt to do anything but expand and collapse 
the tree. The javascript code is output seperately from the actual tree, and so it 
can be overridden to implement more complex behaviors if you like. see the documentation 
for the \f(CW\*(C`javascript\*(C'\fR method for more details.
.PP
It should be noted that each expandable/collapsable level is tagged with a unique \s-1ID \s0
which is constructed from the object instances hex-address and a counter. This means 
if you call \f(CW\*(C`expandAll\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`expandPath\*(C'\fR on the same object in the same output, 
you will have generated two totally different trees, which just happend to look 
exactly alike, but will behave independently of one another. However, abuse of this 
\&\*(L"feature\*(R" is not recommended, as I am cannot guarentee it will always be this way.

options in the \f(CW%config\fR argument are as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "\fIlist_type\fR" 4

This can be either 'ordered' or 'unordered', which will produce ordered and unordered 
lists respectively. The default is 'unordered'.
.IP "\fIlist_css\fR" 4
.IX Item "list_css"
This can be a string of \s-1CSS\s0 to be applied to the list tag (\f(CW\*(C`UL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`OL\*(C'\fR depending 
    upon the \fIlist_type\fR option). This option and the \fIlist_css_class\fR are mutually 
    exclusive, and this option will override in a conflict.
.IP "\fIlist_css_class\fR" 4

.IP "\fIlist_item_css\fR" 4
.IX Item "list_item_css"
This can be a string of \s-1CSS\s0 to be applied to the list item tag (\f(CW\*(C`LI\*(C'\fR). This option 
and the \fIlist_item_css_class\fR are mutually exclusive, and this option will 
override in a conflict.

.IX Item "list_item_css_class"
This can be a \s-1CSS\s0 class name which is applied to the list item tag (\f(CW\*(C`LI\*(C'\fR). This 
option and the \fIlist_item_css\fR are mutually exclusive, and the \fIlist_item_css\fR 
option will override in a conflict.
.IP "\fIexpanded_item_css\fR" 4
.IX Item "expanded_item_css"
This can be a string of \s-1CSS\s0 to be applied to the list item tag (\f(CW\*(C`LI\*(C'\fR) if it has 
an expanded set of children. This option and the \fIexpanded_item_css_class\fR are 
mutually exclusive, and this option will override in a conflict.
.IP "\fIexpanded_item_css_class\fR" 4
.IX Item "expanded_item_css_class"
This can be a \s-1CSS\s0 class name which is applied to the list item tag (\f(CW\*(C`LI\*(C'\fR) if it 
has an expanded set of children. This option and the \fIexpanded_item_css\fR are 
mutually exclusive, and the \fIexpanded_item_css\fR option will override in a conflict.
.IP "\fIlink_css_class\fR" 4
.IX Item "link_css_class"
This can be a string of \s-1CSS\s0 to be applied to the link (\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR tag) which serves as 
the handler to drive the expansion and collapsing of the tree. This option and 
the \fIlink_css_class_class\fR are mutually exclusive, and this option will override 
in a conflict.
.IP "\fIlink_css_class_class\fR" 4
.IX Item "link_css_class_class"
This can be a \s-1CSS\s0 class name which is applied to the link (\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR tag) which serves 
as the handler to drive the expansion and collapsing of the tree. This option and 
the \fIlink_css_class\fR are mutually exclusive, and the \fIlink_css_class\fR option 
will override in a conflict.
.IP "\fInode_formatter\fR" 4
.IX Item "node_formatter"
This can be a \s-1CODE\s0 reference which will be given the current tree object as its 
only argument. The output of this subroutine will be placed within the link tags 
(\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR) which themselves are within the list item tags (\f(CW\*(C`LI\*(C'\fR). This option can 
be used to implement; custom formatting of the node, handling of complex node 
objects.
.IP "\fIradio_button\fR" 4
.IX Item "radio_button"
This will create a radio button for each node of the tree with the \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR 
\&\f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR attribute being the value of this attribute. This is basically a 'macro' 
for the \fIform_element_formatter\fR.
.IP "\fIcheckbox\fR" 4
.IX Item "checkbox"
This will create a checkbox for each node of the tree with the \f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR 
attribute being the value of this attribute. This is basically a 'macro' for 
the \fIform_element_formatter\fR.
.IP "\fIform_element_formatter\fR" 4
.IX Item "form_element_formatter"
This can be a \s-1CODE\s0 reference which will be given the current tree object as its 
only argument. The output of this subroutine will be placed after the list 
item (\f(CW\*(C`LI\*(C'\fR) tags, and if applicable, before the the link tag (\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR). This 
option can be used to add a form element such a radio button or checkbox to 
each element of the tree, which is useful when creating selection widgets.
.IP "\fIuse_tree_uids\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_tree_uids"
This item allows you to bypass the built in unique \s-1ID\s0 generation feature of 
this module and instead use the unique \s-1ID\s0 from the Tree::Simple object itself 
(gotten by calling the method \f(CW\*(C`getUID\*(C'\fR).
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBgetTree\fR" 4
.IX Item "getTree"
A basic accessor to reach the underlying tree object.
.IP "\fBgetConfig\fR" 4
.IX Item "getConfig"
A basic accessor to reach the underlying configuration hash.
.IP "\fBincludeTrunk ($boolean)\fR" 4
.IX Item "includeTrunk ($boolean)"
This controls the getting and setting (through the optional \f(CW$boolean\fR 
argument) of the option to include the tree's trunk in the output. Many times, 
the trunk is not actually part of the tree, but simply a root from which 
all the branches spring. However, on occasion, it might be nessecary to 
view a sub-tree, in which case, the trunk is likely intended to be part 
of the output. This option defaults to off.
.IP "\fBsetPathComparisonFunction ($CODE)\fR" 4
.IX Item "setPathComparisonFunction ($CODE)"
This takes a \f(CW$CODE\fR reference, which can be used to add custom path 
comparison features to Tree::Simple::View. The function will get two 
arguments, the first is the \f(CW$current_path\fR, the second is the \f(CW$current_tree\fR. 
When using \f(CW\*(C`expandPath\*(C'\fR, it may sometimes be nessecary to be able to control 
the comparison of the path values. For instance, your node may be an object 
and need a specific method called to match the path against.
.IP "\fBexpandPath (@path)\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandPath (@path)"
This method will return a string of \s-1HTML\s0 which will represent your tree 
expanded along the given \f(CW@path\fR. This is best shown visually. Given 
this tree:

As you can see, the given path has been expanded, but no other sub-trees 
are shown. However, the other sub-trees are actually there, and can be 
expanded or collapsed by clicking on them. It is worth noting that this 
method will actually output the entire tree, but with only the expanded 
path shown.
.Sp
It should be noted that this method actually calls either the \f(CW\*(C`expandPathSimple\*(C'\fR 
or \f(CW\*(C`expandPathComplex\*(C'\fR method depending upon the \f(CW%config\fR argument in the 
constructor. See their documenation for details.

If no \f(CW%config\fR argument is given in the constructor, then this method is 
called by \f(CW\*(C`expandPath\*(C'\fR. This method is optimized since it does not need 
to process any configuration, but just as the name implies, it's output 
is simple.
.Sp
This method can also be used for another purpose, which is to bypass a 
previously specified configuration and use the base \*(L"simple\*(R" configuration 
instead.

.IX Item "expandPathComplex ($tree, $config, @path)"
If a \f(CW%config\fR argument is given in the constructor, then this method 
is called by \f(CW\*(C`expandPath\*(C'\fR. This method has been optimized to be used with 
configurations, and will actually custom compile code (using \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR) to 
speed up the generation of the output.

This method can also be used for another purpose, which is to bypass a 
previously specified configuration and use the configuration specified 
(as a \s-1HASH\s0 reference) in the \f(CW$config\fR parameter.
.IP "\fBexpandAll\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandAll"
This method will return a string of \s-1HTML\s0 which will represent your tree 
completely expanded. You can then collapse and re-expand any items at 
will though the \s-1DHTML\s0 functionality.
.Sp
It should be noted that this method actually calls either the \f(CW\*(C`expandAllSimple\*(C'\fR 
or \f(CW\*(C`expandAllComplex\*(C'\fR method depending upon the \f(CW%config\fR argument in 
the constructor.
.IP "\fBexpandAllSimple\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandAllSimple"
If no \f(CW%config\fR argument is given in the constructor, then this method is 
called by \f(CW\*(C`expandAll\*(C'\fR. This method too is optimized since it does not need 
to process any configuration.
.Sp
This method as well can also be used to bypass a previously specified 
configuration and use the base \*(L"simple\*(R" configuration instead.
.IP "\fBexpandAllComplex ($config)\fR" 4
.IX Item "expandAllComplex ($config)"
If a \f(CW%config\fR argument is given in the constructor, then this method 
is called by \f(CW\*(C`expandAll\*(C'\fR. This method too has been optimized to be used 
with configurations, and will also custom compile code (using \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR) to 
speed up the generation of the output.
.Sp
Just as with \f(CW\*(C`expandPathComplex\*(C'\fR, this method can be to bypass a previously 
specified configuration and use the configuration specified (as a \s-1HASH \s0
reference) in the \f(CW$config\fR parameter.
.IP "\fBjavascript\fR" 4
.IX Item "javascript"
This method is used to output an \s-1HTML \s0\f(CW\*(C`SCRIPT\*(C'\fR tag which contains the 
javascript used to drive the \s-1DHTML\s0 in this widget. This is not done 
automatically, so that one can optionally override my javascript and 
implement a more complex handler to serve their purposes. The javascript 
function returned is documented here:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBtoggleTree (tree_id)\fR" 5
.IX Item "toggleTree (tree_id)"
The \s-1DOM\s0 element whose \s-1ID\s0 attribute corresponds to the given \f(CW\*(C`tree_id\*(C'\fR is found. 
If its \s-1CSS \s0\fIdisplay\fR property is set to 'none', it is then set to 'block'. 
If its \s-1CSS \s0\fIdisplay\fR property is not set to 'none', it is then set to 'none'. 
This controls the basic expansion and collapsing of the tree widget.

.IX Item "depth-based css"
See this item in the Tree::Simple::View::HTML documentation, since 
Tree::Simple::View::DHTML actually is a subclass of Tree::Simple::View::HTML, 
this functionality would be inherited.
.IP "\fBoptional javascript handler override\fR" 4
.IX Item "optional javascript handler override"
This class implements the javascript handler for the \s-1DHTML\s0 functionally as an 
anchor tag (\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR) whose \s-1CSS\s0 properties can be set, but nothing more. I would 
like to allow this to be overridden, but I want to do it in the correct way 
which will eliminate issues with the \s-1DHTML. I\s0 am still giving this some thought.
.IP "\fBexpand/collapse all javascript function\fR" 4
.IX Item "expand/collapse all javascript function"
An available javascript function which would expand or collapse the entire 
tree. This is would be pretty reasonable to implement since I know all the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`tree_id\*(C'\fRs I have created. However, on large trees, this would inadvisable 
as it would probably bring the browser to a screaching halt.
.SH "BROWSER SUPPORT"
.IX Header "BROWSER SUPPORT"
While \s-1DHTML\s0 in the early days (1998\-2001) was a bug ridden cross\-platform/cross\-browser 
nightmare (believe me I know, I made my living doing it back then). Recent browsers 
(5.0 and above) tend to be able to handle a decent sub-set of \s-1CSS1\s0 and the javascript 
\&\s-1DOM\s0 objects to drive it. This module output \s-1DHTML\s0 which should work on any browser 
that supports \s-1CSS1,\s0 in particular the 'display' property, and \s-1DOM1,\s0 in particular the 
\&'getElementById' method and the ability to manipulate the \s-1CSS \s0'display' property of 
the object that \s-1DOM\s0 method would return.

But in case you don't care that much about \s-1CSS1\s0 and the \s-1DOM,\s0 and just want to know 
what browsers/platforms this supports, here is the list (of ones I have tested so far):

This is also known to gracefully degrade in Netscape 4.7.2, in which it just shows 
the entire expanded tree.

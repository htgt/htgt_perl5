=head1 NAME

Devel::hdb - Perl debugger as a web page and REST service

=head1 DESCRIPTION

hdb is a Perl debugger that uses HTML and javascript to implement the GUI.
This front-end talks to a REST service provided by the debugger running with
the Perl code.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To debug a Perl program, start it like this:

    perl -d:hdb youprogram.pl

It will print a message on STDERR with the URL the debugger is listening to.
Point your web browser at this URL and it will being up the debugger GUI.
It defaults to listening on localhost port 8080; to use a different port,
start it like this:

    perl -d:hdb=port:9876 yourprogram.pl

To specify a particular IP address to listen on:

    perl -d:hdb=host:192.168.0.123 yourprogram.pl

And to listen on any interface:

    perl -d:hdb=a yourprogram.pl

=head2 Interface

The GUI is divided into three main parts: Control buttons, Code browser and
Watch expressions.  Additionally, click on the thick border between the code
and watch panes to slide out the breakpoint list.

=head3 Control buttons

=over 4

=item Step In

Causes the debugger to execute the next line and stop.  If the next line is a
subroutine call, it will stop at the first executable line in the subroutine.

=item Step Over

Causes the debugger to execute the next line and stop.  If the next line is a
subroutine call, it will step over the call and stop when the subroutine
returns.

=item Step Out

Causes the debugger to run the program until it returns from the current
subroutine.

=item Run

Resumes execution of the program until the next breakpoint.

=item Exit

The debugged program immediately exits.  The GUI in the web browser remains
running.

=back

=head3 Code Browser

Most of the interface is taken up by the code browser.  Tabs along the top
show one file at a time.  The "+" next to the last tab brings up a dialog
to choose another file to open.  Click the "x" next to a file name to close
that tab.

The first tab is special: it shows the stack frames of the currently
executing program and cannot be closed.  The stack tab itself has tabs along
the left, one tab for each stack frame; the most recent frame is at the top.

Each of these tabs shows a Code Pane.  The line numbers on the left are struck
through if that line is not breakable.  For breakable lines, clicking on the
line number will set an unconditional breakpoint and turn the number red.
Right-clicking on a breakable line number will bring up a menu where a
breakpoint condition and action can be set.  Lines with conditional breakpoints
are blue.  Lines with actions have a circle outline, and are dimmed when the
breakpoint is inactive.

The banner at the top of the Code Pane shows the current function and its
arguments.  Clicking on the banner will scoll the Code Pane to show the
currently executing line.

Hover the mouse over a variable to see its value.  It shows the value in
whichever stack frame is being displayed.  To see the values for variables
in higher frames, select the appropriate frame from the tab on the left.

=head3 Watch Expressions

The right side of the GUI shows watch expressions.  To add a new expression to
the watch window, click on the "+".  To remove a watched expression, click on
the "x" next to its name.  Composite types like Hashes and arrays have a blue
circled number indicating how many elements belong to it.  To collapse/expand
them, click the blue cicle.

=head3 Key bindings

The debugger responds to these keys, which are generally the same as the
command-line debugger commands

=over 4

=item s

Step in

=item n

Step over

=item <CR>

Repeat the last 's' or 'n'

=item r

Step out

=item c

Continue/Run

=item q

Quit/Exit

=item x

Add new watch expression

=item f

Add new file

=item .

Scroll the code window to show the current line

=item L

Open the breakpoint manager

=item b

Toggle a breakpoint on the current line

=back

=head2 Child Processes

The debugger overrides Perl's fork() built-in so that the child process will
stop with the first statement after the fork().  In the parent process'
debugger window, it will pop up a dialog with two options

=over

=item Open
Open a new browser window and debug the child process inside it

=item Detach
Disables the debugger in the child process, and forces it to run to completion.

=back

=head2 Trace and Follow mode

Devel::hdb can trace the execution of a program and stop if the code path
differs from that of a previously saved run.  First, run the program in trace
mode:

  perl -d:hdb=trace:<tracefile> yourprogram.pl

In trace mode, the program runs normally, and the debugger does not stop
execution.  It records information about which lines of code were run into
the specified file (tracefile, in this example).  Next, run the program
again in follow mode:

  perl -d:hdb=follow:<tracefile> yourprogram.pl

This time, the debugger starts up normally, stopping on the first line of the
program.  As the program runs, the debugger reads the trace information from
the specified file.  The first time the current location is different than
what is in the file, the debugger will stop and report which line it expected.
After it stops in this way, follow mode is disabled.
